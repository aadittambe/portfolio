# 👨🏽‍💻 My website
Codebase for my personal [website](https://aadittambe.com/). 

The site is scaffolded with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) as a micro CMS, so I can catch typos.

## 🧰 Development
 Download the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/aadittambe/graphics-starter.git
```

Install `npm` dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Download data from the Google Doc (thanks to [this script](https://github.com/the-pudding/starter/blob/master/scripts/fetch-doc.js) from The Pudding.):
```
npm run download
```

Start the development server:
```
npm run start
```

## 🛠️ Build the app
