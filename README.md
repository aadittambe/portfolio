# 👨🏽‍💻 My website
Codebase for my personal [website](https://aadittambe.com/). 

The site is scaffolded with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) as a micro CMS, so I can catch typos easily. A GitHub Action automatically builds and deploys this site to my FTP server when changes are pushed to the repository, because I like automation.

## 🧰 Development
 Download the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/aadittambe/graphics-starter.git
```

Install `npm` dependencies:
```
npm install
```

This site uses a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnWLWaUz2b-ho5QxBcjh5jdxF4Gf_K2gumFWfyma4xc/) as an ad-hoc CMS. To fetch data from the Google Doc — thanks to [this script](https://github.com/the-pudding/starter/blob/master/scripts/fetch-doc.js) from The Pudding which uses ArchieML — run:
```
npm run download
```

Start the development server:
```
npm run start
```

## 🛠️ Build site
A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/aadittambe/portfolio/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) automatically builds (and deploys the site to my FTP server) when changes to this repository are pushed to GitHub. So all you However, to manually build it for local testing, run:
```
npm run build
```

## 🪖 Deploy site

The same GitHub Action mentioned in the earlier step deploys it to my FTP server with `ftp-deploy` when changes are pushed. However, to manually deploy, you can run: 
```
npm run deploy
```
